team member: th7, jackiey

Enviroment and package required:
python 3.6, opencv 3.2.0 (with community contribution), numpy, scipy, sklearn

Note: we run it under MAC OS Sierra. Thus we used homebrew for installation.

Commands we used for installation:

```bash
brew install python3
brew install opencv3 --with-python3 --with-contrib --with-nonfree
pip3 install numpy
pip3 install scipy
pip3 install sklearn
```
